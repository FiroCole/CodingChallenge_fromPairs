  ## :pencil: Challenge Overview
The Pairs challenge is of intermediate difficulty and requires writing a function that creates an object from an array containing nested arrays. Each nested array represents key/value pairs used to create corresponding key/value pairs in the object to be returned by the function. If a key appears in multiple pairs, the rightmost pair should overwrite the previous entry in the object.

## :white_check_mark: Solution Overview

Key aspects of my approach to a solution include:

- Iterative Approach: The solution iterates through the input array, extracting key/value pairs and adding them to the object.
- 
- Overwriting Behavior: When encountering duplicate keys, the solution ensures that the rightmost pair overwrites the previous entry in the object.
  
- Efficiency: The function is designed to handle arrays of varying lengths efficiently, providing a reliable solution.

## :old_key: Key Features

- [:x:] Accurate conversion of nested arrays into key/value pairs in an object.
- [:x:] Proper handling of duplicate keys, ensuring the rightmost pair takes precedence.

## :sparkles: How to Use
To use this function in your project, simply include the function in your JavaScript file.
